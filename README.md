## Run on your machine


By default, will use hsqldb with dev profile:

>mvn jetty:run

Use with pgsql (dev) 

>mvn jetty:run -Pdev-pgsql


## Notes


When running with hsqldb, you can launch the integrated db manager with:

>mvn jetty:run -DstartDBManager

You will need to do a refresh (View -> Refresh Tree) to see the up to date schema.


## Gradle Build

This build includes a copy of the Gradle wrapper. You don't have to have Gradle installed on your system in order to build
the project. Simply execute the wrapper along with the appropriate task, for example

>./gradlew clean

###Â Running with multiple profiles

You must specify a project property at the command line, such as

>./gradlew -Pprofile=dev :bootRun

The following profiles are supported

 * dev
 * dev-pgsql
 * docker-test

You can get a list of all supported Gradle tasks by running

>./gradlew tasks --all

You can configure additional System properties (if you need them) by creating the following file and putting into it one property per line:
> vi custom.jvmargs
